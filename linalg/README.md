NOTE: at first I was going to do MP with MP, but that turned out to be alot more annoying than I hoped it would be because of CMake and AppleCLang. Instead, I just starting manually multi-threading with std::thread. MatrixMP.cpp and TensorMP.cpp are the versions that include multi-threading in their method definitions.
